    <h1>Langton ants written in rust</h1>

## Why again?

I wanted to compare the same program written in two different languages, one python and the other rust. Also because I wanted to practice with rust.

## Compile and run

1. You must [install rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your computer.

2. Install the sdl2 library.

3. Clone or download this repository.

4. Go to the directory and write:

```Terminal
$ cargo run
```
